- Vite
- Lucide React (for icons)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v9 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe.git
   cd tic-tac-toe
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist` directory.

### Docker Deployment

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t tic-tac-toe .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 80:80 tic-tac-toe
   ```

#### Custom Port Configuration

If port 80 is already in use, you can specify a different port:

1. Using a different port when running the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -e PORT=8080 -p 8080:8080 tic-tac-toe
   ```

2. Or map the container's port 80 to a different host port:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:80 tic-tac-toe
   ```

## How to Play

1. Choose your game mode (Player vs Player or Player vs AI) using the toggle button
2. In Player vs Player mode:
   - Players take turns clicking on the board
   - X goes first, followed by O
3. In Player vs AI mode:
   - You play as X
   - The AI plays as O
   - The AI is unbeatable and uses the Minimax algorithm
4. The game automatically resets when:
   - A player wins
   - The game ends in a draw

## AI Implementation Details

The AI in this game uses the Minimax algorithm to create an unbeatable opponent. You can find the implementation in `src/App.tsx`.

### How the AI Works

The Minimax algorithm works by:
1. Simulating all possible moves
2. Evaluating each move's outcome
3. Choosing the move that maximizes the AI's chances of winning while minimizing the player's chances

Key functions in the implementation:

1. `minimax(squares: Board, depth: number, isMaximizing: boolean): number`
   - Located in `src/App.tsx`
   - This is the core algorithm that recursively evaluates all possible moves
   - Parameters:
     - `squares`: Current board state
     - `depth`: Current depth in the game tree
     - `isMaximizing`: Whether it's maximizing (AI) or minimizing (player) turn
   - Returns a score for the current board state

2. `getBestMove(squares: Board): number`
   - Uses the minimax algorithm to determine the optimal move
   - Returns the index of the best possible move for the AI

3. `handleAIMove()`
   - Triggers the AI move after a short delay
   - Implements the chosen move on the game board

### Scoring System

The AI evaluates positions with the following scoring:
- Win for AI (O): +10 - depth
- Win for Player (X): depth - 10
- Draw: 0

The depth is subtracted/added to prefer winning in fewer moves and delaying losing as long as possible.

### Code Structure

```typescript
// Core minimax algorithm
const minimax = (squares: Board, depth: number, isMaximizing: boolean): number => {
  const winner = checkWinner(squares);
  if (winner === 'O') return 10 - depth;      // AI wins
  if (winner === 'X') return depth - 10;      // Player wins
  if (getAvailableMoves(squares).length === 0) return 0;  // Draw

  const availableMoves = getAvailableMoves(squares);
  let bestScore = isMaximizing ? -Infinity : Infinity;

  for (const move of availableMoves) {
    squares[move] = isMaximizing ? 'O' : 'X';
    const score = minimax(squares, depth + 1, !isMaximizing);
    squares[move] = null;
    bestScore = isMaximizing ? 
      Math.max(score, bestScore) : 
      Math.min(score, bestScore);
  }

  return bestScore;
};
```

This implementation makes the AI unbeatable - the best a player can achieve against it is a draw.
